bio: Hey, I'm Gopalji, a student and a Machine Learning enthusiast. In addition to
  dwelling among the interconnections of the Neural Networks, I sometimes like to
  wrap my head around various web development projects. Most of my projects are hobby
  projects I made during my free time. Some of my important projects are Algorithm
  for reduction of handovers in 5G Networks, about which I published a <InlineLink

  Another project, Reversible Multi-Res U-Net Image in Image Steganography was a part
  of my Bachelors thesis.
education: I have graduated from <InlineLink href="https://vit.ac.in">Vellore Institute
  of Technology</InlineLink> with a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
  I am studying Masters in Computer Science at <InlineLink href="https://uni-freiburg.de">University
  of Freiburg</InlineLink>.
work: |-
  I interned at <InlineLink href="https://bel-india.in">Bharat Electronics Limited</InlineLink> in the summer of 2019, where I learned about production and testing of Radar display systems. And during the summer of 2021, I was an intern at <InlineLink href="https://www.ctoan.co.in">Ctoan Technologies</InlineLink> where I implemented a LoRA WAN stack on a low-powered microcontroller for communication between client nodes and server.

  Right now, I am on the lookout for internship opportunities. You can download my resume <DownloadLink href="/static/docs/Resume of Gopalji Gaur.pdf">here</DownloadLink>.
